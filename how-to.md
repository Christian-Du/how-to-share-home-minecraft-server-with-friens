# This will become a how-to to set up your Minecraft server at home and references to other articles to make it accessible to your friends.

## What's my setup?  
I have a little home server with Proxmox installed, and in that, I'll create a virtual machine with Debian as the OS that will run the Minecraft server.  
I have a few different approaches to share the server with the internet. I'll explain how to set up my router and a DynDNS service that only works with a public IP, and the other ones rely on a server on the internet that works as a reverse tunnel server.

Please note: I'm doing this for fun, to step out of my comfort zone and improve my writing skills. I plan on doing this one bit at a time and might skip parts if the muse isn't passing my way. So please be patient.
